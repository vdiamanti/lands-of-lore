World of Warcraft Guild Website

This project is based on one of my favorite MMO-rpg games called World of Warcraft. 
I was an avid player since 2004 when the vanilla WoW came out. I spent the next 8 years of my life playing the game and its expansions,
meeting new people online and arranging guild days out and it helped me with setting strategic goals both online and in my personal life.
I stopped playing the game after 2012 as I wanted to focus more on my professional development and I believed I could not do everything that I 
wanted at that time, if I kept on playing. To be honest, having a sub and playing once every two weeks was not budgetary viable at that point.
In 2017 I joined again the game, as I had more space and time to actually make the sub worth it. Since then, I met again plenty of people, 
I became a GM as well in a social guild with 450 members from all over the world and I would love to be able to put my newly found coding skills
to test by creating a web page for my lovely international game friends. 

Code style
I will get to write everything in html5, add css and start looking at various bootstrap themes and even maybe some javascript (time to get my script knowledge tested!)
By the way, js is basically like Excel on steroids... kinda scary! 

If people like my project, please share - we need more women in coding and UX/UI design and it would be an honor for me to be able to help
just a tiiiiny bit by showing what simple coding can do.

I will also try and write notes under each big block of code, so as to help myself with remembering where things are but also to show whoever is
reading the code the thought process behind it (I hope there is a thought process behind it..!!)

If you want to contribute to my gaming coding adventure, please email me on vdiamanti@gmail.com with the subject "lol wow contribution".

Credits
Just shoutouts and credits to all my guild friends who passed me (or will pass me) some images and inspo for this. Also, I would like to say that I 
looked at various websites and I will list them here as we go along. 

If you have instagram and you like cats, dogs and normal people stuff follow me: qria_v.

See you on the other side! \m/
